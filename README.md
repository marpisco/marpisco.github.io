My personal website's code.

## Table of Contents
On the root of this repository there are 3 files. The site itself, the README you're reading, and the pointless license (because nobody will ever actually use this other than myself).

## License
This repository and work are licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3.0**. You can read the license and research about it.

## Warranty
This website will be updated whenever I need it updated, and whenever I feel like it. There isn't a schedule of updates for it.

## Credits
Nobody else other than me worked on this project. Have an idea or a better way to do what I did? Great, make a pull request and I might approve it.
